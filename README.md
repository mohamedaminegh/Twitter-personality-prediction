# Twitter personality prediction with NLP

Predict the personality of Twitter users from their posts using deep learning

In this project we are uing BERT for TensorFlow 2.0
We also use tensorflow_hub, which basically is a place where you can find all the prebuilt and pretrained models developed in TensorFlow. We will be importing and using a built-in BERT model from TF hub.

The twitter_personality_prediction_with_bert_(I-E) is used to binary classifier Introverts and extroverts but we aim to generalize it to work on the 16 personalities.
